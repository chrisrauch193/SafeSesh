             will trigger a sobriety test. If passed, you can continue to spend! Otherwise, Safe Sesh will freeze your account!</h3>

        <h2> How safe is Safe Sesh? </h2>
        <h3> Our customers' safety is our number one concern, so we've been working with Uber, and are hopeful that we will be able to order you<br>
             a ride before we freeze your account! Users would have the ability to opt out of this feature, but we wouldn't reccoment it! <br>
             We provide our users with both a Webapp AND mobile app for IOS devices (Android support coming soon!). Both of which contain our challenging<br>
             sobriety test!

        <h2> Upcoming Features!</h2>
        <h3> This is only the beginning for Safe Sesh, and are bursting full of ideas to implent! Some of these ideas include calibration for the sobriety test,<br>
             which would allow for a wider range of peoples to use our app, including the elderly and people with motor disabilites! Also in progress is an audio
             interface for the deaf, and the aforementioned Uber integration to help you home after a great sesh!
